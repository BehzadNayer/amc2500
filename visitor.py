"""
A basic implementation of the "visitor pattern" for Python, using decorators.

Inspiration from http://chris-lamb.co.uk/2006/12/08/visitor-pattern-in-python/
which contains a description of such a system but no implementation code that I could find

And http://www.artima.com/weblogs/viewpost.jsp?thread=101605 in which Guido van Rossum
shows how dynamic dispatch ("multi-methods") can be done.

Please don't use this module for evil messes :), only use it when a visitor pattern will actually
eliminate lots of nasty boilerplate code.


Simple example:

@when(str)
def myFunc(arg):
    print "My string has length %d" % (len(arg))
    
@when(int)
def myFunc(arg):
    print "My integer is %d" % arg

myFunc("XYZ")
My string has length 3

myFunc(12)
My integer is 12


Advanced/Silly features:

Optionally, multiple overloads can be called in sequence when visiting a class hierarchy.
So, if you have annotated visitor methods for both a superclass and a subclass, the visitor
pattern will optionally call first the superclass and then the subclass. The result of such "cascaded" superclass calls is discarded.

Example:

class Superclass:
    def __init__(self):
        pass
class SubA(Superclass):
    def __init__(self):
        pass
class SubB(Superclass):
    def __init__(self):
        pass

@is_visitor
class MyVisitor:
    @when(Superclass, allow_cascaded_calls=True)
    def foo(self, s):
        print "I am a superclass call"
        return 1

    @when(SubA)
    def foo(self, a):
        print "I am a subclass A call"
        return 2

v=MyVisitor()
a=SubA()
b=SubB()

Output:

v.foo(a)
I am a superclass call
I am a subclass call
2

v.foo(b)
I am a superclass call
1
