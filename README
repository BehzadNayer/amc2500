This is a rough attempt at working with the AMC2500 stepper controller via a serial port, 
from Python code.

amc2500 is a simple Python module for sending commands to the controller
gcode is a parser for a simple subset of gcode (aiming for the commands used by Inkscape gcodetools)
jogger is a hacky WX widgets interface to get the contoller moving about

This has no more work done than two hacker's idle time over a weekend at the moment, so don't expect too much. :)

It's all implemented via sniffing the serial protocol, unsupported, and may never work properly (looks like we may be removing the
AMC2500 from our PCB Engraver and driving it directly from EMC via parallel port.)

Still... enjoy :)
